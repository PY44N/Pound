This a small text editor written entirely in Rust. It's based on this [tutorial 
written in C](https://viewsourcecode.org/snaptoken/kilo/index.html).

This [tutorial](https://medium.com/@otukof/build-your-text-editor-with-rust-678a463f968b) is meant to introduce programming in a fun and easy to understand way. It's also meant to be
used as a starting point for writing console based text editors and command line interface.

To use, clone the repository and execute
```
cargo run --release
```
You can also pass a file name as an argument. For instance
```
cargo run --release /src/main.rs
```
